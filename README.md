# EssentialModules
Essential modules are topics that are not part of our official curriculum, but are essential to the mastery of programming in general. 
You should read through each topic in sequential order as the skills you learn in prior topics will be useful as you progress. 

We will start off by talking about taking a look at the command line and what you will be using it for, we then move into some more advanced CLI topics. 
Once you have mastered the command line, we will move on to using git in the CLI and also take a look at how github works. 

After you are sufficiently familiar with the command line, SSH and github we will understand how to provision instances in the largest and fastest growing cloud platform on earth, AWS.
We will then dig into the details of configuring a webserver, getting a domain name and pointing that domain name to your new instance, so everyone on the planet can see your work over the internet. 

Excited? Lets get started!
